What is a Goroutine?

A goroutine is a lightweight function that runs independently.
It is much cheaper than a thread (doesnâ€™t need much memory).
You create a goroutine by adding go before a function call

Imagine a coffee shop where:

One barista (main function) makes coffee.
You hire assistants (goroutines) to make multiple coffees in parallel.
